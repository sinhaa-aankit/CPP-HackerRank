A class defines a blueprint for an object. We use the same syntax to declare objects of a class as we use to declare variables of other basic types. For example:

Box box1;          // Declares variable box1 of type Box
Box box2;          // Declare variable box2 of type Box
Kristen is a contender for valedictorian of her high school. She wants to know how many students (if any) have scored higher than her in the  exams given during this semester.

Create a class named  with the following specifications:

An instance variable named  to hold a student's  exam scores.
A void input() function that reads  integers and saves them to .
An int calculateTotalScore() function that returns the sum of the student's scores.
Input Format

Most of the input is handled for you by the locked code in the editor.

In the void Student::input() function, you must read  scores from stdin and save them to your  instance variable.

Constraints


Output Format

In the int Student::calculateTotalScore() function, you must return the student's total grade (the sum of the values in ).

The locked code in the editor will determine how many scores are larger than Kristen's and print that number to the console.

Sample Input

The first line contains , the number of students in Kristen's class. The  subsequent lines contain each student's  exam grades for this semester.

3
30 40 45 10 10
40 40 40 10 10
50 20 30 10 10
Sample Output

1
Explanation

Kristen's grades are on the first line of grades. Only  student scored higher than her.
